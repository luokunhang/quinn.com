## I see your value now.

I am a data scientist in training. Graduated from University of Washington in 2020 with a major in [Applied and Computational Mathematical Sciences](https://acms.washington.edu/), I am an incoming student of [Master of Science in Analytics](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/analytics/) at Northwestern University.

I am always actively looking for internship and full-time job as a data scientist or machine learning engineer.
